# Plans, Designs and Documentation
This section is a place for all of my miscellaneous work. Be it network designs, help desk plans, security documents or otherwise, it can all be found here.

# System Vulnerabilities
As a part of our security course in the first semester, we were tasked with using nmap to scan for open ports on nodes within our closed network. We then documented the ports that were open, their description, application PID and associated them with an executable running on the system. Finally, we researched and documented possible vulnerabilities related to these executables.

(Several of the entries for our vulnerabilitity document, including open ports, port description and associated executable and vulnerabilities.)

# System Designs
One of our courses revolved around designing and analyzing systems and networks, creating flowcharts, diagrams and documents for the creation of a new school and hospital network.
