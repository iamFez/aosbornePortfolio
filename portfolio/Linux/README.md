# Linux
A large part of my education, and my favorite part, revolved around working within the Linux environment. As such, I have experience with configuring and managing both personal and enterprise-level Linux environments, including the configuration of LDAP, DHCP, DNS, VPN, Firewalls and FreeIPA. 

I am also experienced with bash scripting and task automation using cronjobs. On this page you will find some samples of the Linux work I have completed.

## FreeIPA
An interesting contrast to Active Directory was the installation and configuration of FreeIPA for Identity Management. This was used to monitor and track users, groups and hosts on our domain.

## Scripting
Scripting was a major asset and something that I enjoyed immensely. Throughout my time with NSCC I created scripts for file manipulation, user and group management and to get system information and activity.

## Rescue Disk
For the final of one of our Linux courses, I was tasked with the creation and configuration of a Linux rescue disk. As a part of the creation of this rescue disk, I modified a base install of Bodhi Linux with custom boot text, a custom background and pre-installation of the following software:

* memtest86+
* partimage
* chkrootkit
* chntpw
* mbuffer
* btrfs-tools

## Capstone (Book of Arcana)
A large part of our final semester involved working with a team of individuals from multiple streams (programming, web development, systems) towards the creation of a 'product' of our choosing. I was a part of a team consisting of two programmers, two systems administrators and a web developer. As a part of this team, I helped with installing the required dependencies for both our game and web servers, our documentation, asset creation and user and file management on a remotely-hosted CentOS 7 server.
