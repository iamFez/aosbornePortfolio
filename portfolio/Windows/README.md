# Windows
I have worked with Windows personally since a young age, and have worked with Windows Server in an enterprise environment extensively during my time with NSCC. From Active Directory, to Group Policy, DHCP, DNS, VPN, Firewalls, SCCM, SCO, Hyper-V and WSUS. 

On this page you will find some samples of the work that I have completed thus far.

## DHCP
Throughout my time spent with NSCC, whenever we were tasked with work within the Windows environment we would frequently be required to configure our primary domain controllers for both DHCP and DNS.

## Windows Server 2016 Core
Though we only covered it once, during our first semester we created and configured a Windows Server 2016 R2 DataCenter Core installation for use as a file server.

## System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM)
During our enterprise networking course, we were required to configure a Windows Server 2016 virtual machine with SCCM. Afterwards, we used SCCM to manage computers and sites, and to deploy applications to nodes on our network.

## Folder redirection and drive mapping
One assignment in our first semester had us learn how to configure folder redirection and drive mapping for users within the domain using group policy.
