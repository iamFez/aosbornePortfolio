## Who am I?
IT Systems Management & Security graduate experienced with managing both physical and virtual Linux and Windows environments and small to enterprise-level networks. Though I have limited real-world experience, I am passionate about the work I do and eager and willing to learn.

## What have I done so far?
Whilst attending Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC) for my high school diploma in 2016, I was given the opportunity to work towards a diploma in IT Systems Management & Security. From January 2017 until now I have been learning the ins and outs of many technologies, including but not limited to:

Linux (Various flavors), Apache, MariaDB, MySQL, Cisco IOS, IOS XE and XR, DNS, DHCP, VPN, Firewalls, IDS/IPS, Windows Server, Active Directory, GPO, SCCM, SCO, VMWare, ESXi, Hyper-V, WSUS and LDAP. 

## Where will I go from here?
After finishing my work term and graduating from NSCC I plan to take a short break before beginning my search for employment. In the meantime, I will continue to touch up my skills and study to take Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSA) exams 70-740, 70-741 and 70-742 as part of earning an MCSA in Windows Server 2016.
